# 🌐 Aurelio's Personal Web Portfolio

Hi there! 👋 I'm Aurelio Hevi Alfons, and this is my personal portfolio — crafted with Flutter Web to reflect my creativity, skills, and growth.

This space is more than just a webpage — it's a showcase of my university projects, freelance work, designs, and everything in between. Whether it's mobile development, UI/UX design, or digital media, you'll find a piece of me in every section.

Every detail, from the custom icons to the subtle animations, was thoughtfully designed to represent how I work and who I am.
